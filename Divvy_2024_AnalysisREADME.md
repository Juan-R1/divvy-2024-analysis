## ❓ Key Questions
- How do casual and member riders differ in usage behavior?
- When do people ride most — by hour, day, and season?
- What are the most popular start stations?
- What insights can inform business decisions?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)
- GitHub (version control + publishing)

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Members** ride significantly more than casual users and are most active on weekdays during commuting hours.
- **Casual riders** take longer rides, with peaks on weekends and in warmer months — indicating leisure/tourist behavior.
- Ride volume spikes in **summer**, drops in winter.
- Top start stations are near high-traffic and tourist locations.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- 🕓 **Adjust bike availability** around rush hours (members) and weekends (casuals).
- ☀️ **Plan for summer surges** in casual rider demand and place extra bikes near tourist areas.
- 📣 **Promote memberships** with weekend-to-member conversion offers.
- 🛠️ Expand or maintain stations near top-usage start locations.
